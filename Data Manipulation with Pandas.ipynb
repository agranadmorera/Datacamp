The purpose of this workspace is to allow you to experiment with the data from [Data Manipulation with pandas](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/data-manipulation-with-pandas) and practice your newly learned skills with some challenges. You can find out more about DataCamp Workspace [here](https://workspace-docs.datacamp.com/getting-started).\n",
